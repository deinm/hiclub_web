The content of the course is more about general culture than a law class. You'll debate about current topics (euthanasia, demonstration, abortion) regarding the actual American situation. The professor speaks good english. We had two quizzes during 20min, and a open-book final exam at home. The final exam was more difficult than what we were doing in class, so it was a bit disappointing, but we finally all had good grades. For me, this class was okay, not bad, but not excellent; I found it not really attractive to hear."

It's a small class, so the professor is very available, kind, and the atmosphere was very friendly. She's American, so you won't have any issue with her English speaking. Regarding the class, the content is pretty wide: we studied about history of law in East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan), human rights, constitutionalism... We attended some conferences, and visited the Korean Constitutional Court. There is no midterm or final since it's a master degree class, you'll have to write 2 short papers (3/4 pages), then you'll have to choose a subject to write a research paper about it (about 10 pages) and you'll have a oral presentation."
